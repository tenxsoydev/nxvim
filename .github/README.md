## Getting Started

At present, first-hand instructions are only provided for Linux.
However, since there is not much wizardy involved following along on other platforms should be straightforward.

### Prerequisites

Prevent interferences with current Neovim files.

- Using the default config path `~/.config/nvim`

  1. Backup your current nvim config

     ```sh
     mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak \
     && mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
     ```

     Or remove it

     ```sh
     rm -rf ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim
     ```

  1. Clone the repository
     ```sh
     git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim.git ~/.config/nvim
     ```

- Or, using `$NVIM_APPNAME`

  1. Export the environment variable

     ```sh
     export NVIM_APPNAME=nxvim
     ```

  2. Clone the repository

     ```sh
     git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim.git ~/.config/$NVIM_APPNAME
     ```

<br>

### Dependencies

Probably, most necessities are already installed.

1. Neovim >= 0.9
2. Packages

   - APT systems

     ```sh
     sudo apt install git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd-find sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev trash-cli
     ```

   - Arch systems

     ```sh
     sudo pacman -S git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd sqlite trash-cli
     ```

3. Client support for modules communicating with nvim api objects

   - Node client for neovim

     ```sh
     npm install -g neovim
     ```

   - Python client for neovim

     ```sh
     pip install pynvim
     ```

     In case Node and Python need to be installed first, please refer to their documentation.

4. Fonts
   - [Nerd font][20]
   - [Unicode font][30] (If none is installed by default, noto font packages are usually also available via your distros package manager).
   - `fc-cache -fv` helps to update font info cache files when new fonts have been added manually.

### Post installation

- First run

  Launch `nvim` and let lazy do it's magic, loading all modules used in this config.
  There may be warnings regarding missing dependencies during this first installation. Just skip them hitting return.
  Once all tasks have been completed, restart nvim <kbd>ZQ</kbd> `nvim`.

- Last steps
  - Run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` to make sure command line fuzzy search works correctly, as it utilizes some python.
  - Add language servers / formatters. E.g.:
    - Add the `lua` LSP
      ```sh
      LSPInstall lua_ls
      ```
    - Also install the formatter used for this config
      ```sh
      NullLsInstall stylua
      ```
  - Have fun using it!

- Candies like animated auto window widths, dimming of unfocused windows and smooth scrolling.

- Coding completions; writing aids; a command-palette with error tolerant typehead completion for commands settings and variables.

## Acknowledgements

Just like most other neovim configurations, this one includes a collection of plugins. It wouldn't be imaginable without the contributions of so many developers in the open source space. Kudos to every author who contributed to the modules used in this configuration.

- modules = { [nxvim/lua/nxvim/init.lua][70] }

## Disclaimer

> Currently, this is rather my personal daily driver then a general-use product. Making it public was driven by colleagues and friends who were interested in getting a share of this config and then liked using it. Getting surprisingly positive feedback even from my grumpiest colleague, led me to believe that this configuration might well have utility for others. However, **it may never reach the level and support of a general-use project**.

<br>

Feel free to use and modify it. Give the project a star to show support if you have found inspiring parts or to keep up to date.

### License

The config uses GPLv3 licensed plugins, therefore it is licensed under GPLv3.
Nxvim's own code is written under a more permissive Apache license. Therefore it
will result in GPLv3 limitations being removed when not using these plugins.
Please refer to the LICENSE files for detailed information.
