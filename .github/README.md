### Quick and dirty demos

- Candies that make a GUI-like TUI are animated auto window widths, dimming of unfocused windows and smooth scrolling.

- Among all regular suspects like coding completions and writing aids it includes several helpers like a command-palette with error tolerant as-you-type-completion for commands, settings & variables.

## Getting Started

To prevent interferences with current Neovim files...

```sh
# ...either back them up:
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak && mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
# ...or remove them:
rm -r ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim
```

<details>
<summary><h3>Dependencies <sub><sup>Click to expand...</sup></sub></h3></summary>

Probably most stuff is already installed.

1. neovim nightly (statuscol support)
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob">bob</a> is a good way to keep the latest and/or nightly version up to date.
2. Packages
   - TL;DR: for a deb. based system: `sudo apt install git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd-find sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`
   - TL;DR: for an arch based system: `sudo pacman -S git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd sqlite`
   - git
   - curl
   - unzip
   - xsel (linux only)
   - ripgrep
   - fd
   - sqlite
3. Client support for modules communicating with nvim api objects
   - use your preferred method or refer to the corresponding docs to ensure node and python are installed
   - node client for neovim `npm install -g neovim`
   - python client for neovim `pip install pynvim`
4. Fonts
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/#patched-fonts">nerd font</a>
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji">unicode font</a> (If none is installed by default, noto font packages are usually also available via your distros package manager)
   - `fc-cache -fv` helps to update font info cache files when new fonts have been added manually

#### Frist run

Launch `nvim` and let <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lazy</a> do its magic, automatically loading all the modules utilized in this config. You may encounter some warnings regarding missing dependencies. Just hit return on them for now. Once all tasks have been completed, restart nvim <kbd>ZQ</kbd> `nvim`.

#### Last steps

- Run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` mainly to make sure command line fuzzy search works correctly, as it utilizes some python
- Programming language support
  - The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim">mason</a> plugins allow an effortless setup of language support for your projects
    - you can start off by adding the `lua` LSP that'll help to work with this config
    - `:LSPInstall` `lua_ls`
  - To add additional formatters and linters we'll use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim">null-ls</a>
    - let's also install the formatter used for this config
    - `NullLsInstall` `stylua`

**Note on Performance**

- On low-spec systems, performance can be improved by changing `animation.fps = 30 -- instead of 60` in `plugins/windows.lua` and - in case of using terminals with font ligature rendering support - disabling them (e.g. with kitty: by adding `disable_ligatures always` to your `kitty.conf`)
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Usage Recommendations (optional) <sub><sup>Click to expand...</sup></sub></h3></summary>

- My best experience has been with [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty). A feature-rich, GPU accelerated terminal with its core written in `C`.
- It's optimized for use with the official dracula colorscheme in a "pseudo-transparent" style.
- For usage inside a terminal any used colorscheme should be matched with the colorscheme of the terminal.
  - In case you are interested in the one used on the screenshots: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tobealive/dots/tree/tooltime/.config/kitty">tobealive/dots/tooltime/.config/kitty</a>
- Alternatively, a graphically enriched - but functionally slightly compromised - experience using [neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/) with multigrid enabled might be worth the trade-off for you.
- A simple hack for ergonomics in a keyboard-driven development is remapping Escape. One doesn't need a programmable keyboard to do this, since the keyboard settings in any desktop environment support simple modifications. So one could make Caps lock behave as an additional Esc and Shift+Caps as regular Caps.

## Acknowledgements

Just like most other neovim configurations, this one includes a collection of plugins. It wouldn't be imaginable without the contributions of so many developers in the open source space. Kudos to every author who contributed to the modules used in this configuration.

- modules = { [nxvim/lua/nxvim/init.lua](https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim/blob/main/lua/nxvim/init.lua#L15) }

## Disclaimer

> Currently, this is rather my personal daily driver then a general-use product. Making it public was driven by colleagues and friends who were interested in getting a share of this config and then liked using it. Getting surprisingly positive feedback even from my grumpiest colleague, led me to believe that this configuration might well have utility for others. However, **it may never reach the level and support of a general-use project**.

<br>

Of course, you are free to use and modify it. Share a â˜… if you don't consider it robbery and feel free to reach out if you experience any issues.
