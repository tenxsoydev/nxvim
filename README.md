### Some previews in moving pictures

Candies that make a GUI-like TUI are animated auto window widths; dimming of unfocused windows and smooth scrolling.

All regular suspects like coding completions and writing aids. Including several helpers like a command-palette with error tolerant as-you-type-completion for commands, settings & variables.

## Getting Started

To prevent interferences with current Neovim files...

```sh
# ...either back them up:
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak && mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
# ...or remove them:
rm -r ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim
```

### Dependencies

Probably most stuff is already installed.

1. neovim nightly - _statuscol support_
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob">bob</a> is a good way to keep your latest and/or nightly version up to date
2. Packages
   - TL;DR: for a deb. based system: `sudo apt install git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd-find sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`
   - TL;DR: for an arch based system: `sudo pacman -S git curl unzip xsel ripgrep fd sqlite`
   - git
   - curl
   - unzip
   - xsel (linux only)
   - ripgrep
   - fd
   - sqlite
3. Client support for modules communicating with nvim api objects
   - use your preferred method or refer to the corresponding docs to ensure node and python are installed
   - node client for neovim `npm install -g neovim`
   - python client for neovim `pip install pynvim`
4. Fonts
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/#patched-fonts">nerd font</a>
   - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji">unicode font</a> (If none is installed by default, noto font packages are usually also available via your distros package manager)
   - `fc-cache -fv` helps to update font info cache files when new fonts have been added manually

### Frist run

Once all dependencies have been installed, launch `nvim` and let <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lazy</a> do its magic automatically loading all of the modules utilized in this config.
During this initial run, you may encounter some warnings regarding missing dependencies. Just hit return on them for now. Once all tasks have been completed, restart nvim <kbd>ZQ</kbd> `nvim`.

### Post installation

- Run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` mainly to make sure command line fuzzy search works correctly, as it utilizes some python
- Programming language support
  - The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim">mason</a> plugins allow an effortless setup of language support for your projects
    - you can start off by adding the `lua` LSP that'll help to work with this config
    - `:LSPInstall` `lua_ls`
  - To add additional formatters and linters we'll use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim">null-ls</a>
    - let's also install the formatter used for this config
    - `NullLsInstall` `stylua`

**Note on Performance**

- On low-spec systems, performance can be improved by changing `animation.fps = 30 -- instead of 60` in `plugins/windows.lua` and - in case of using terminals with font ligature rendering support - disabling them (e.g. with kitty: by adding `disable_ligatures always` to your `kitty.conf`)

## Personal Usage Recommendations

- My best experience has been with [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty). A feature-rich, GPU accelerated terminal with its core written in `C`.
- It's optimized for use with the official dracula colorscheme in a "pseudo-transparent" style.
- For the best experience match it with the colorscheme of your terminal
  - in case you are interested in the one used on the screenshots: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tobealive/dots/tree/tooltime/.config/kitty">tobealive/dots/tooltime/.config/kitty</a>
- Alternatively, a graphically enriched - but functionally slightly compromised - experience using [neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/) with multigrid enabled might be worth the trade-off for you.

## Acknowledgements

Just like most other neovim configurations, this one includes a collection of plugins. It wouldn't be imaginable without the contributions of so many developers in the open source space. Kudos to every author who contributed to the modules used in this configuration.

- modules = { [nxvim/lua/nxvim/init.lua](https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim/blob/main/lua/nxvim/init.lua#L17) }

## Disclaimer

> Currently, this is rather my personal daily driver then a general-use product. Making it public was driven by colleagues and friends who were interested in getting a share of this config and then liked using it. Getting surprisingly positive feedback even from my grumpiest colleague, led me to believe that this configuration might well have utility for others. However, **it may never reach the level and support of a general-use project** and it's propagation will be limited to giving attributions in credits.

Those who are seeking tools that can turn Neovim into a full-fledged IDE, which are developed by brilliant programmers, have great support and a thriving community should consider the following repositories:

- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- [nvim-ide](https://github.com/ldelossa/nvim-ide)
